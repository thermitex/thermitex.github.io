			<details>
				<summary>Does Cuckoo only support iOS?</summary>
				<p>That is right. In the future there may be an Android version, depending on my capacity.</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>Is iOS 13 or older supported?</summary>
				<p>Currently not. Cuckoo is developed with iOS 14 in mind, and if you have a system older than iOS 14 you cannot use widgets (which I think is a great feature). I would recommend you to update to the latest iOS, and in the future I may expand some compatibility.</p>
			</details>

			<details>
				<summary>I believe I have entered the correct account credentials, why can't I connect to Moodle?</summary>
				<p>There could be many reasons that Cuckoo cannot reach Moodle. Besides incorrect credentials, the network connectivity and the status of your account will also affect the connection to Moodle. Please note that if you refresh with an incorrect password for several times, Moodle will lock you out for 30 minutes because of excessive failures, which also cuts the connection from Cuckoo to Moodle. To verify that, log into Moodle using a browser.</p>
